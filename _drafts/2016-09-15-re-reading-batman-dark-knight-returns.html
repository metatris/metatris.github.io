Whenever I read Frank Miller's work nowadays, it's hard to separate the story from what I know about his personal politics. Whenever I see an issue presented in a very nuanced way, I wonder if I'm seeing nuance that wasn't actually supposed to be there, if it was meant as pure propaganda and I'm just imagining that it has some depth. He makes this so, so much harder to determine because he <i>does </i>use strawmen to make his points sometimes, which plants a seed of doubt: if he uses strawmen sometimes, maybe he actually uses strawmen all the time, and whatever nuance I see is just an illusion.<br /><br />But <i>Batman: The Dark Knight Returns</i> uses nuance a little too often for me to believe that its presence was completely accidental. It uses symbolism and layers of meaning a little too well for me to think I'm completely imagining it.<br /><br /><i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>, which I gave a cursory glance ten years ago (ten? Wow, really that long?), encapsulates one of the chief reasons I love comic books and superhero stories: they let writers explore big social themes in an exciting way, while also allowing the story to be rich on a personal level by following the relationships and inner conflicts of identifiable characters. Richard III and Henry VIII and Abraham Lincoln existed in the real world, and Clark Kent did not; but Clark Kent is identifiable in a way that the other three are not. Even though he's an alien, Superman is human; even though kings and presidents are human, when I read a story that follows one, I never feel that they're human on the same level as I am. The personal life of a president is a show put on for the media to win reelection or support for a policy. Even though the personal life of Superman is a show in the sense that he's not even from Earth, it's also genuine in the sense that it's something he doesn't need to have, but he has it because he wants it. The same goes for any real-life figure that a story could follow to explore the kind of issues that superhero stories explore: some gulf of years or experience temperament separates me from them, and rarefies the story in my eyes.<br /><br /><i>The Dark Knight Returns</i>, like much of Batman,<i> </i>explores the idea of vigilante activism in a time when crime is out of control and the state can't protect its people. It actually rises one level above this, though, to creep up on the suggestion that at some point the criminals and the vigilantes surpass the state and become like warlords, fighting for control of a territory while the legitimate government becomes irrelevant. Batman's first challenge, once he comes out of retirement, is the Mutants gang, whose leader more than once declares himself the new ruler of Gotham and greets the Mayor's attempt at negotiation with attempted murder by filed off teeth. Batman recognizes that the Mutants follow their leader because of his strength, and after being defeated once, devises a trap where he can overcome the leader's strength advantage with tactics. When the Mutants see their leader defeated, they disband. A group of them becomes the Sons of the Batman, and starts carrying out violent vigilante justice in Batman's name.<br /><br />Every event in <i>The Dark Knight Returns </i>is followed, as so often in real life, by the vapid commentary of a television news show and its stable of polarizing pundits. Batman also faces Two-Face and the Joker, both released from "Arkham Home for the Emotionally Troubled" by Wolper, a bleeding-heart psychiatrist who thinks they're just misunderstood. Wolper is Miller's most blatant strawman.&nbsp; I would've had an easier time swallowing him if he were just an armchair pop psychologist giving interviews for the news, but he is their actual doctor at Arkham, and I just don't buy it. Miller's rival Alan Moore presented a much more convincing picture of a psychiatrist attempting to treat a super in <i>Watchmen</i>, with Malcolm
