There was a period of time in my life, not so long ago, when browsing Anime and Manga Stack Exchange was the only thing that got me out of bed in the afternoon. I mean it: without a new helping of Monogatari series and trope questions to research the hell out of and post answers to, I probably would have just stayed in bed until it was time for dinner, gotten up to eat, stayed up long enough to stare through an episode of <i>The Walking Dead</i>, then gone back to bed. Instead, I would get up at 2 PM, obsess over the front page of A&amp;M SE until it was time for dinner, eat, stare through an episode of <i>The Walking Dead</i>, then obsess over the front page of A&amp;M SE until 2 AM, when I would go back to bed and restart the whole cycle.<br /><br />Those days are over. I don't miss them. But it does make me sad that they had to take Anime and Manga Stack Exchange with them, their final spiteful blow against me.<br /><br />There's still the occasional gem of a question, and if I have something to ask about a relatively well-known series, I can usually get a decent answer. But the magic is just gone.<br /><br />We've always had problems with awful id questions. If you haven't been on Anime and Manga, Science Fiction and Fantasy, Movies and TV, or Arqade, let me explain: some genius decided at some point that it would be a fun idea to have the entertainment sites take questions where people describe some work they vaguely remember, but can't recall the title of. The experts on the sites, using their vast knowledge of the medium and superior research skills, would identify this work, gaining applause and fake Internet points from their fellow experts and the praise and gratitude of oppai and loli alike.<br /><br />It turns out that asking questions on SE sites is actually kind of hard. It takes thoughtfulness, experience, and a certain level of mastery of the subject matter. Even a question like "Can the Death Note kill someone if you know their face before they get a mole and they later get a mole so their face isn't exactly like you remember it but you don't know that because you haven't seen them recently and didn't look at their most recent pictures on Facebook before you tried to kill them?", as dumb as it is, requires you to have read/watched Death Note, to have absorbed the rule that Death Notes require a name and face to kill, and to have spent a little time thinking about that rule and what its implications might be. You have to put in a little work even to come up with kind of a stupid question.<br /><br />Asking id questions, on the other hand, isn't hard at all. It's really easy. Just toss off the most vague, generic description of a show you can, and the magical wizards will find it based on your totally brain-damaged hints.<br /><br />You really have to spend some time reviewing these questions to understand where all the nerd rage about them comes from. When I first came to the site, it bugged me that so many of them don't use capitalization and think you can string three paragraphs together as one long sentence with clauses separated by ellipses, but I didn't see anything wrong with the questions themselves. But reviewing them wears on you. No one seems to put any thought into what they're actually communicating. No one realizes, for instance, that an id question is not a whimsical story about one's childhood. It's not a wistful yet solemn reflection on the mistakes and glories of one's youth, conceived as a prologue for one's memoir. No one realizes this, so everyone begins the question with the phrase "When I was younger", or perhaps "Long ago" or "When I was a child".<br /><br />I did that above. I wrote, "There was a period of time in my life, not so long ago". That's because I <i>am </i>writing a narcissistic memoir, and vague timeframes serve such writing. But id questions are not memoirs or fascinating slice of life stories. They're not&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsSGKP7Bntg&amp;list=PL76CDAA60523D615A&amp;index=3">Louie Anderson introducing a story about the value of hard work</a>. They're more like police reports. Imagine a police interrogator, instead of asking "Where were you on the night of January 17th, 1987", asking "Where were you when you were younger?"<br /><br />The Metaclass, that storied clan of high-reputation users who hang out on Meta complaining about things, responded to this problem in the usual way. It took to the Meta site, and proposed a software feature that would block any question containing the phrase "When I was". We members of the Metaclass have advanced various proposals on Meta to make id questions suck less. These proposals have so far failed to stem the tide, they just put up lots of bureaucratic red tape in the way of people who want to post awful id questions. This is really more of a curse on our own house, because then we have to spend all of our time shepherding people through the process of posting an id question, at the end of which they still usually have a crappy question, it just doesn't say "When I was younger" anymore.<br /><br />Even the non-id questions have gotten crappier. The tropes questions used to be one of my favorite categories, and even the more naive ones would have the seed of someone seeking knowledge. But now they're so naive they're not even worth answering. Or it just wears on me more. Who knows. It's just not fun to be on the site anymore. Even the drudgery used to have kind of a geniality to it. We were like an academic department who achieved camaraderie by our shared experiences of helping a bunch of students who weren't the sharpest tools in the shed get through courses that were way above their level. That's gone now.
