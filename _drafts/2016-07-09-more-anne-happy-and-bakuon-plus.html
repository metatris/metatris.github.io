I mentioned before that I hate watching new shows as they air because of the delay, but this time I found a way to get through it: pick three shows, one that airs on Saturdays (Flying Witch), one that airs on Mondays (Bakuon!!), and one that airs on Thursdays (Anne Happy), and fill in the gaps with shorts and (gasp!) stuff other than anime. <br /><br />Anne Happy and Bakuon!! actually have something in common: they're both cute girls shows that have gone heavily back in the direction of early 2000s zany comedy, instead of continuing the 2010s K-On-inspired cute girls and iyashikei trend that resulted in some amazing shows (like K-On itself) alongside more than a few merely competent sleepers (like Kiniro Mosaic).<br /><br />The major difference between them is that Bakuon!! really succeeds as a zany comedy. It's genuinely funny, in that bizarro Love Hina sort of way (Love Hina around mid-series, not the more grounded earlier volumes or the later ones that were clearly trying to evolve into Negima). It doesn't go fully back to Di Gi Charat the way Miss Monochrome does; it's still basically grounded in reality, but some over-the-top strangeness intrudes.<br /><br />The concept is basically K-On with motorcycles. The girls are members of a motorcycle club at school. Hane Sakura is a ditz who rides a Honda; Onsa Amano is a bike otaku who rides a Yamaha; Rin Suzunoki is a blonde, twin-tailed tsundere who rides a Suzuki. They're the relatively normal ones. Then you have Hijiri, a rich girl with delusions of being a delinquent, who spends most of the series riding the sidecar while her butler drives; Kawasaki Raimu, who doesn't speak and never takes off her helmet, so her face remains shrouded in mystery; and Nakano Chisame, a champion minibike racer conflicted about moving to street bikes, who's such a ripoff of Azu-nyan that she even has the same last name.<br /><br />The early episodes were more wacky comedy. Hijiri beats Raimu at chicken by driving off a cliff, Hane meets Motorcycle Jesus on her ride to Hokkaido, and we see the numerous childhood tragedies that made Rin who she is today (along with seeing what a humongous dork she is). Unlike most cute girls shows, Bakuon!! doesn't shy away from dirty jokes; Hane's conversations with her training motorcycle at the driving school (yes, it talks, and everyone can hear it, not just Hane), where it compares being a training motorcycle to being a prostitute, are disturbing (but also pretty hilarious). Since Episode 8 or so, it's made a play to become more of a traditional cute girls show and honestly gone downhill. The characters just aren't suited to that style; they're too much zany comedy characters and not lovable enough. Episode 12 was the nadir of the series; it's boring and the comedy doesn't really work, and it relies too much on Hane, who isn't really a good character. (Onsa and Rin are the stronger characters.) <br /><br />Anne Happy uses the same mix but has the opposite problem. It tries to be a zany, high-concept comedy and is pretty awful at it, but it's not entirely terrible as a cute girls show. The girls are cute, at least. And the art is quite nice. The botanical gardens from the end of Episode 4 are worthy of an episode of Aria. The forest from Episode 6 is lush and verdant, and the rainy skies of Episode 7 are oppressive and gloomy enough that I wanted to stay inside, even though it was actually sunny and warm.<br /><br />Even though I've mostly stayed unimpressed with Anne Happy, I have to give it credit for Episode 10. The episode shows the girls' summer vacation, with a framing device where Botan writes about each experience in her diary, chronicling her first summer with actual friends. Ever since Episode 4, we've been seeing Hibiki slowly become less annoying, and also start to like Hanako. (She has a grudge against Hibari over something stupid, but she ends up deciding, wisely, to let the universe wreak her vengeance instead of trying to ruin Hibari. Her grudge against Hibari was pretty annoying, so this really helped make her less annoying.) In Episode 10, we actually get to see the groups get shuffled up a little, when Hibiki and Hanako get lost together in the school after dark, and Hibari. Botan, and Ren go in to find them. After getting chased around a lot, the girls end up on the roof together watching the fireworks from the summer festival they were at. The final scene, and Botan's interstitials where she writes in her diary, were sweet, and even if the cross-group scenes were short and not very meaty, at least they did it. I dislike it when shows, especially ones about a group of people who spend a lot of time together, never mix the cast in new ways. When <br /><br />One thing that bugs me about the cute girls doing cute things episodes of Anne Happy is that they always end in a moral. Seriously, why do we need a moral? Just accept that your entire audience is guys in their twenties who are morally bankrupt, and we want to stare at cute girls, not learn life lessons. It's as if Madoka had Sailor Says sequences.<br /><br />
