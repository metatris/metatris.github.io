<p>The song “Let It Go” from the Disney film <em>Frozen</em> has often been interpreted as a generic paean to banal ideas like “be yourself” and “let the real you shine through”, but it is entirely possible that, if one really examines the lyrics closely, it has a different and far more sinister interpretation. Consider that Queen Elsa, the character who chants these lyrics at our children, is both the absolute monarch of a small nation and inexplicably disgruntled, secretive, and able to wield superhuman powers, and we gain a picture of her as a radical leftist with an anti-democratic philosophy, an inherent hatred of free markets, and deep hostility towards men (as seen in her treatment of Prince Hans).</p><p>If we consider “Let It Go” with this interpretation of the character in mind, we see that the song actually represents the moment Elsa decides to reveal herself as a fascist, anti-corporate, anti-gun, man-hating dictator, ruling by the power of her magic and the fear and complicity of a people cowed by endless winter and barely able to feed themselves from the infertile, snow-covered land that Elsa has created. Let’s examine the song.</p><blockquote><p>The snow glows white on the mountain tonight.<br />Not a footprint to be seen.<br />A kingdom of isolation, and it looks like I’m the queen</p></blockquote><p>Elsa notes here that Arendelle has become diplomatically and culturally isolated since her father died, similar to authoritarian Communist dictatorships such as Cuba and North Korea, and that she is now the queen and unchallenged ruler of this “hermit kingdom” (except for the threat of Anna’s future suitor; Anna herself is pliant and easy to manipulate, but a suitor could pose a challenge to Elsa’s rule, which is why she rejected Prince Hans so stridently).</p><blockquote><p>The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside<br />Couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried</p></blockquote><p>Elsa comments that she’s tried these past few years to uphold the values of her nation, in word if not in spirit, but she finally reached a point with her coronation where she realized that with her father dead, she could allow her own anti-democratic tendencies to come to the fore.</p><blockquote><p>Don’t let them in, don’t let them see<br />Be the good girl you always have to be<br />Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know<br />Well, now they know</p></blockquote><p>Elsa describes the mindset she took to hide her authoritarian persuasion and sexist tendencies: by refusing to “let them in” or “let them see” her true hatred for freedom and for men, and playing “the good girl” that she “always ha[d] to be”, a good girl who would never shut down commerce, tax the job creators, and throw out competent male advisors in favor of corrupt, incompetent ones who either happen to be female or are weak and yielding enough to act as rubber stamps for Elsa’s policies. She tried to conceal her true desires, and avoid feeling them or showing any sign of them, but her authoritarian leaning has become obvious, and “now they know”.</p><blockquote><p>Let it go, let it go<br />Can’t hold it back anymore<br />Let it go, let go<br />Turn away and slam the door</p></blockquote><p>Elsa has resolved to “let it go”. She uses this phrase with two different meanings in this passage. In the first, she follows with “Can’t hold me back anymore”, signifying that she is now going to let “it”, her militant left wing matriocratic ideology, loose upon the people she rules, grinding them down under her radical feminist bootheel. In the second, she follows with “Turn away and slam the door”, signifying that she is going to let Arendelle’s constitution, crafted by the Founding Fathers to uphold democracy, freedom, and property ownership, “go”, “turn away” from it, and “slam the door” on it.</p><blockquote><p>I don’t care what they’re going to say<br />Let the storm rage on<br />The cold never bothered me anyway</p></blockquote><p>Elsa knows her people will murmur with disquiet when she begins dismantling the protections of the Bill of Rights by taking away their guns, subjecting them to illegal searches and seizures, and curtailing their free speech. However, she will ensure they have no power to fight back by letting the storm rage on, destroying their property and the ability of the land to feed them. This won’t affect her because she will send jackbooted thugs to collect what little food the people do produce as taxes, so the cold will never bother her, anyway.</p><blockquote><p>It’s funny how some distance<br />Makes everything seem small<br />And the fears that once controlled me<br />Can’t get to me at all</p></blockquote><p>“Distance” is metaphorical; Elsa now considers herself a higher being, above all others, atop a pedestal from which she looks down at everything, which now seems small. The fears that once drove her to maintain democratic rule and a nodding relationship with the Constitution can’t get to her at all.</p><blockquote><p>It’s time to see what I can do<br />To test the limits and break through<br />No right, no wrong, no rules for me<br />I’m free</p></blockquote><p>Elsa now intends to start undermining the democracy that her family upheld for generations, and to see how much she can get away with. She’ll test the limits by first using pseudo-legal measures such as executive orders and shady backroom deals with private sector apostates and Big Charity to achieve her far left extremist agenda, but when those prove insufficient to continue her march towards militant lesbian autocracy, she’ll “break through” and use force and direct coercion to achieve her ends. Elsa believes she is beyond primitive notions of good and evil and can do whatever she wants because there is no right or wrong or any rules for her. In so declaring, she also implies her agenda to use her cult of personality to set herself up as a god, destroy all churches, make practicing the Christian religion illegal, and establish death camps for any Christian who refuses to give up their beliefs and set Elsa as a false idol in the place of the one true God and His only begotten son, our lord and savior Jesus Christ.</p><blockquote><p>Let it go, let it go<br />I am one with the wind and sky<br />Let it go, let it go,<br />You’ll never see me cry<br />Here I stand and here I stay<br />Let the storm rage on</p></blockquote><p>Elsa’s secret police will have eyes everywhere searching for dissenters. The secret police’s network of spies and informants will be so expansive that it will gift Elsa with near-omniscience, as if she were “one with the wind and sky”, and so able to be everywhere and see everything. This will ensure that you never see her cry, and also that she will continue standing and staying exactly where she is, because any action by her people which might cause her to cry or endanger her position will be swiftly rooted out and squashed due to the omniscience afforded her by her secret police and monitoring system.</p><blockquote><p>My power flurries through the air into the ground<br />My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around<br />And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast<br />I’m never going back, the past is in the past</p></blockquote><p>Elsa realizes that she has even more power than she thought now that her militant fascist attitude has combined with her ice powers. She has suddenly become aware that she has the power to execute a pogrom of white men among her advisors and bring in transgender Muslims to fill those positions and plan a genocide of white heterosexual men among the general population.</p><blockquote><p>Let it go, let it go<br />And I’ll rise like the break of dawn<br />Let it go, let it go,<br />That perfect girl is gone<br />Here I stand in the light of day<br />Let the storm rage on<br />The cold never bothered me anyway</p></blockquote><p>Elsa is going to rise like the break of dawn and stand in the light of day, having left the darkness, and lay her intentions bare, declaring her intention to repeal democracy, suppress dissent, and create a police state ruled by militant lesbian leftist kleptocrats, with herself as grand despot, ruling over Arendelle with a cult of personality based on her godhood. Revealing this to the outside world will cause a political storm as her own people and other countries oppose her, but she can weather this storm since “the cold never bothered me anyway”. This is an ironic metaphorical callback to her earlier literal statement about creating a storm to destroy her people’s ability to feed themselves or engage in any economic activity not sanctioned by her corrupt cabinet of anti-male anti-hetero transgender lesbian socialist Muslim suicide bombers.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Queen Elsa represents a threat to American democracy. She is determined to turn all of our daughters and as many of our sons as possible into man-hating transgender socialist Feminazis and to create a world in which it is illegal to own a gun or a business and heterosexual white men are interned in death camps where they are forced to either submit to gender reassignment surgery or die in the gas chamber while their wives have sex with blacks and Jews outside.</p><p>The only way to stop this travesty is to fight back against Queen Elsa and her servants, the Disney Corporation, by making our own children’s movies that teach real American values, such as gun ownership, the natural dominance of white alpha males over women and other pathetic men with small penises, beating up egghead dorks who are into science and have small penises, and a view of God as the ultimate alpha male with the largest penis of all. Only then will we be able to take our children, and our country, back from the socialist lesbian genocidal maniac with ice powers known as Queen Elsa.</p>
